The system will automatically sends the start signal when you click 'Run Match!', but if you can't see any cameras, click 'Mode' on the app's menu bar and hit 'Send Start Signal' there.

If you need to adjust which cameras are plugged in, click Mode in the menu bar and select "Configure System". Refer to above instructions to send start signal, which will return the system to normal function.

If some systems don't work, make sure you are connected to NetworkTables, since it will not continue until it successfully connects. 
Note: You cannot swap cameras or adjust camera quality without NetworkTables.
